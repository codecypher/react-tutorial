/**
 * State and Lifecycle
 * Adding Local State to a Class
 * Adding Lifecycle Methods to a Class
 * https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html
 *
 * Using State Correctly
 *
 * There are three things you need to know about setState():
 * 
 * 1. Do Not Modify State Directly, use setState().
 * 
 * 2. State Updates May Be Asynchronous
 * 
 *    This means that this.props and this.state may be updated asynchronously,
 *    so you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.
 *
 * 3. State Updates are Merged
